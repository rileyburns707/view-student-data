# View Student Data (Frontend)

This is a simple frontend interface that interacts with the [Student Data API](https://student-data-public-api.onrender.com).  

It allows users to view all students, view an individual student, add a new student, and delete a current student records.


Please note: since I am using the free version of Render the first call you make will be slow as it has to reconnect. 


## Deployed Frontend
The final website can be view here: [View Student Data on Render](https://student-data-frontend.onrender.com)

## Features
- View all students  
- View a student by ID  
- Add a new student  
- Delete a student  

All actions update the backend API in real-time.
